  When I first approached TypeScript, I anticipated it to be very different from JavaScript, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much the two languages share. 
TypeScript feels like an extension of JavaScript, enhancing its features without dramatically changing anything. 
As someone who considers themselves a newbie, though I’ve dabbled with JavaScript before—specifically building a few Discord bots for me and my friends server with tutorial help. I found the transition to TypeScript smoother than expected. 
My initial concern that it would be far more complex than JavaScript. Come to find out it wasn't and I even noticed similarities to Java, which I’ve worked with in the past (ICS 111 and 211).

  In this module, I learned a lot of new concepts, especially the distinctions between var, let, and const, and how objects are structured within TypeScript. 
These nuances of TypeScript make it easier to avoid common JavaScript pitfalls, such as variable scoping issues. The type safety feature in TypeScript, which enforces strict types and helps catch errors during development, was a welcome addition. 
This helped me understand how the language prioritizes clarity and reliability over the flexibility that JavaScript is known for.

  From a software engineering perspective, I believe TypeScript is a robust and well-structured language. It uses the flexibility of JavaScript with the type safety. 
This, in my opinion, makes it more enjoyable and versatile to use than Java, especially since TypeScript allows for static typing while maintaining a lightweight feel. 
Its strong support for object oriented programming and also makes it an ideal tool for large-scale projects.

  Regarding athletic software engineering, the WODs (Workout of the Day) were a challenging yet effective way of learning. I had never been asked to code under time pressure before, except for the occasional ICS 211exam, but that environment is quite different from what the WODs ask of you.
The time constraints and pressure to perform efficiently in WODs were nerve-wracking, especially during my first group session. My mind was stressed, and it was hard to think clearly. However, I noticed gradual improvement and felt more comfortable coding under pressure.

  This style of learning, while initially stressful, is ultimately beneficial. It simulates real-world coding situations where you must be quick, efficient, and think critically under pressure skills that will undoubtedly be helpful in technical interviews and professional work environments. 
The stress does exist, but it is a constructive kind that forces you to improve. Over time, I’m confident I will become more accustomed to it and find it more manageable.

In conclusion, my experience with TypeScript and the WODs has been overwhelmingly positive. While I was nervous at first, both the language and the learning style have pushed me out of my comfort zone in ways that feel productive.
I believe TypeScript’s structured and enjoyable syntax, along with the athletic software engineering practices, will not only help me improve my coding skills but also prepare me for future challenges in software engineering.
