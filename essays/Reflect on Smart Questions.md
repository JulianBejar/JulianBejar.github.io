## Importance for Future Software Developers

  Raymond's smart question guideliness are very important for any upcoming software engineers as it teaches them the proper way to ask for assistance or advice for something that you need to know. In computer science, asking questions are very important as there is a lot of things you need to grasp. I'm sure even the best developers out there still ask questions all the time. However a lot of things people tend to ask are questions that could have easily been found if the person searched about it first. Another thing is depending on how you ask the question, it may lead to more questions being asked than answered if it is not structured well. As a developer, you don't want to waste time on trivial details that are easily identifiable.

## The Reason for its Importance

  Obviously when asking questions especially on a forum, you'd only wanna ask questions that haven't already been answered as what is the point when you yourself could have found the answer if you just dug around more. For example: [**Forum**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/what-is-the-difference-between-let-and-var) this was a question asked almost 16 years ago regarding the differences between the use of the let and var keywords. It is now one of the most viewed and popular forum posts on Stack Overflow. Now this is a question asked a little over a year ago pretty much asking the same thing: [**Forum**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76010295/when-should-you-use-var-let-or-const-in-javascript-code) it has only one reply that wasn't very detailed and actually probably confused the OP more as well as much less upvotes compared to the first one meaning people most likely disregarded the question as something not important to answer. Also when asking a question, the more specific info you provide, the easier it typically is for others to answer your question and thus gives you a more detailed and comprehensive answer to your question. The first post had a link that led to a short description of the let keyword whereas the second question provides no other info other than asking for more opinions. It also reflects a person's aptitude as the second person seemed to have just asked the question right after being introduced to how variables work is JS whereas the first seemed to already have a general idea of what it was, but just needed that grounding statement that helped him.

## Insights

  I've actually already known that a lot of people on forums typically resort to asking a question right away rather than researching it themself. This experience only solidified it more. I don't have much of an opinion on people who ask smart or not so smart questions because at the end of the day I may also ask both types of questions here and there. Although not so smart questions may not get as much traction as the smarter ones, it's good for me as a developer because I can look at multiple forum posts on the same thing if I'm struggling and it will give me more information as the answers will typically ever so slightly differ on each one. However, I hope to ask smarter questions in the future as it is important in moving forward with my software engineering goals.
