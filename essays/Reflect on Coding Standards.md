  After my first week of using ESLint I can say that it is a nice feature to have. The excess of red lines (errors) do bother me and the fact that spacing matters so much is kind of annoying, but I really like the fact it can detect a lot of issues before you even run it. I don’t mind getting rid of the errors all the time as it is actually quite satisfying for me to do so and it is very useful because it adheres to coding standards which a lot of classes and maybe even jobs in the future will require you to follow. Having ESLint tell you these things will allow you to learn the standards faster and utilize it in the future. It makes the code more understandable and cleaner looking too which I find really good. I do wonder though whether ESLint can be used for other languages like C or Java. From what I hear it can’t, but it would be incredibly useful if it could as well. Another thought is will tools like this make developers more lazy or is it actually good to have. Overall, I think ESLint is good to have as it can help programmers identify problems without having to go through too much trouble.
