## The First Code

I had always been a sort of tech guy. I was always situated at my computer doing different things such as researching the hardware, playing games, browsing online. However, the topic of coding never really came across my head. This all changed when I got the funny idea to mess with my friends by making a Discord bot that would banter with them. As mentioned in my projects, I made a Discord bot using Javascript that would reply to people in my server with a snarky attitude and would occasionally send funny gifs or images. At the time of making the bot, I had almost zero prior coding experience with the exception being a comptetion I did involving a lego robot which I'll delve more into later. I pretty much just wanted to do it for fun. It was really difficult, I had no fundamentals and even though I followed a step by step tutorial, there were still a lot of errors some how. These errors were hard to identify because again I had no knowledge of coding or Javascript and no fundamentals down. After a ton of researching I was able to get it to work and that felt incredibly satisfying to do. This acutally was the basis of why I became sort of interested in coding for the future.

## Early Days of my Tech Journey

I previously mentioned that I actually did have slight experience in coding. That was because in my last years of grade school and actually early middle school, I was in a lego robotics club that coded a lego robot using scratch. This club would participate in competitions in our district and if you win that you would head to states where you would compete with the winners of other districts in your state. The robot would have to complete a set of tasks the competition would give us. These tasks included traversing a certain path or shooting a ball into a goal. From what I remember, scratch was very limited to code on and it kind of made it clunky to navigate the robot around properly. My team and I had to run a lot of tests and even if the tests work, there's a lot of factors that could impact the way the robot moved. We did end up winning district and participating in states, but the competition in state was on a whole other level. Overall the experience really boosted how in tune I was with technology and made me all the more interested in it.

## Why I Turned to CS

My family had always been in the health field. Both my parents were nurses and it seemed like I was on the road to become one as well. When I first joined University I was actually a nursing major. However during the whole first semester as a nursing major, I kept wondering if that was what I truly wanted to do. I felt I didn't have much interest in the field and the idea of 13 hour shifts kind of bothered me. After a talk with my family, I switched to CS. It is definitely more enjoyable to me than nursing and I feel this is truly what I would like to learn in University. It was a hard decision, but I am glad I did it.
