summary: "My robotics club and I competed in a competition for lego robotics in which the robot has to do a specific set of tasks that we programmed it to do."

Although this was long ago, this was something that pushed me towards a more technology route for my future.

My team and I had to use a robot made from legos and a computer to navigate and do certain tasks in a competition such as shooting a ball in a goal.
