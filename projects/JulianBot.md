Around this time, I had pretty much zero experience in coding. I was proficient in most things computer related however. Often troubleshooting and building PCs. This time period was also when I started using Discord more often especially with my friends. We would play games or just hang out in the voice channels talking. If you know anything about discord, you would know that they offered a variety of different bots online that you could invite to your server to do different things. Our server had bots as well, but they were pretty much just music bots or bots that would help maintain the server. I then got an idea that I thought would be really funny. I  thought to myself why don't I code a bot that makes jokes and banters with the people in the server when talked to.

Since I had zero coding experience prior to this, I was lost. So I had to use tutorials on YouTube. I tried to find one that was quick, concise, and easy to follow along with. I eventually found one that instructed me to use VSCode as the IDE and Javascript as the main language. From what I remember, this took me a few days to complete with hours spent on it per day even with a tutorial. I ran into many problems even after following the tutorial step by step. Eventually I was able to complete it and got it to join my server. When you mention it in the server you could pretty much have a short conversation with it (mostly banter). It also had the ability to generate random gifs.
