summary: "My family and I helped our local island community during the pandemic by providing masks from the clinic or masks that we had created."

This isn't as much a project as the last one, but it is something significant that I was able to do and I think it helped the community a good deal. As most of us know, the pandemic was really big and it impacted pretty much the whole world. Online class, delays, curfew. It changed our lifestyles. I lived on Kauai during this and it wasn't that easy to get masks. Either too little left because of panic buying or too pricy like the N95 masks. So, my family and I decided to help the community by handing out masks.

Around this time, I wasn't actually in the track to become a computer science major, I was more inclined to health because both my parents were registered nurses. More on this in my essay. My family and I began distributing masks that we had or created all over the island. At bus stops, convenience stores, and gas stations. The masks were made using a sewing machine that my father had recently bought and the material to make it was easy to get as there was a major fabric store on the island. A great deal of people appreciated the gesture and I thought I made a good change on the island and for my future.
